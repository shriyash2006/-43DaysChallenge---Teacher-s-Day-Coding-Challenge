#43DaysChallenge - Teacher's Day Coding Challenge 2025
Overview
Welcome to my #43DaysChallenge - Teacher's Day Coding Challenge repository, part of the Mission #DrGViswanathan initiative by the Placement & Training (PAT) Cell of VIT Bhopal University. This 43-day coding marathon, starting July 25, 2025, is a tribute to teachers and a step toward achieving big career goals, like securing the first 1 crore package at VIT Bhopal. The challenge involves solving one Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem daily to build problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and interview readiness.

Challenge Details

Objective: Solve one DSA problem each day for 43 days, inspired by the theme of Teacher's Day.
Tracks: Beginner or Advanced, based on skill level.
Tasks:
Solve a daily DSA problem from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces.
Push the solution to this repository in a folder named Day_X (e.g., Day_1, Day_2).
Record the problem-solving process (as if explaining to an interviewer) and upload to YouTube (daily or weekly).
Share progress on LinkedIn with hashtags: #TeachersDayChallenge, #VITBhopal, #VITBhopalUniversity, #VIT, #DrGViswanathan.


Repository Structure:
Each day's solution is in a dedicated folder (Day_1, Day_2, etc.).
Each folder contains:
Source code (e.g., solution.py, solution.cpp).
A README.md with the problem statement, approach, complexity analysis, and learnings.
Optional: Link to the YouTube video of the solution explanation.




Incentive: Completers receive a small reward from the PAT team.

How to Use This Repository

Navigate to the folder for the specific day's problem.
Read the README.md in each folder for the problem description and solution details.
Check the code file (e.g., solution.py) for the implementation.
Watch the linked YouTube video (if available) for a walkthrough of the solution.
Run the code locally by following the instructions in each day's README.md.

Getting Started
Contribute: Feel free to suggest improvements or share your own solutions via pull requests.
