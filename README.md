# 🎓 #43DaysChallenge: Teacher's Day Coding Challenge 2025

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to my **#43DaysChallenge** repository! This marathon is part of the **Mission #DrGViswanathan** initiative by the Placement & Training (PAT) Cell of VIT Bhopal University.

Starting **July 25, 2025**, this 43-day journey is more than just a coding streak; it is a tribute to our teachers and a strategic step toward excellence—aiming for the milestone of the first **1 Crore package** at VIT Bhopal.

> "The dream begins with a teacher who believes in you, who tugs and pushes and leads you to the next plateau."
